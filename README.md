# FirstProjects
These are my first few projects I've done when it comes to programming, machine learning, data cleaning and EDA, and otherwise. These are mostly done in Jupyter and will be labeled to describe the purpose of the project and whether or not it was for a course of done individually. This serves as a portfolio showing what I can do within the lense of data science, machine learning, and programming.
